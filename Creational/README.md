# Creational Patterns
Design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

### Some of the most commonly used creational design patterns include:

1 Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

2 Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3 Abstract Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4 Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

5 Prototype Pattern: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, through cloning.
