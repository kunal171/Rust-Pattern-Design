# FOLD
Run an algorithm over each item in a collection of data to create a new item, thus creating a whole new collection.

The etymology here is unclear to me. The terms ‘fold’ and ‘folder’ are used in the Rust compiler, although it appears to me to be more like a map than a fold in the usual sense.

The fold pattern, often referred to as the fold function or fold operation, is a higher-order function commonly used in functional programming languages. It's a versatile and powerful tool for aggregating or accumulating data over a collection, such as a list or an array. The fold function takes a binary operator, an initial accumulator value, and a collection, then iterates over the collection, applying the binary operator to each element and the accumulator to produce a single result.
