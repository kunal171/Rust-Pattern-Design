# VISITOR
The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It enables you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. The key idea behind this pattern is to define a separate visitor object that traverses the elements of the object structure and performs operations on them.

Here's how the Visitor Pattern works:

1 Element Interface: Define an interface that represents the elements in the object structure. This interface typically declares an accept method that accepts a visitor.

2 Concrete Elements: Implement concrete classes that represent the elements in the object structure. These classes should implement the element interface and provide an implementation of the accept method.

3 Visitor Interface: Define a visitor interface that declares a visit method for each concrete element class. Each visit method takes a specific element type as an argument.

4 Concrete Visitors: Implement concrete visitor classes that implement the visitor interface. Each concrete visitor provides an implementation for each visit method to perform operations on the elements.

5 Object Structure: Create a class that represents the object structure. This class should maintain a collection of elements and provide methods to traverse them.

6 Accept Method: Implement the accept method in each concrete element class to invoke the corresponding visit method on the visitor object.
