/*RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):
Rust's ownership system, combined with the Drop trait, follows the RAII principle. 
Resources are acquired when a value is created and released when the value goes out of scope. 
This approach ensures deterministic cleanup without relying on garbage collection.

While there isn't a direct equivalent to finalization in Rust, 
the combination of ownership, lifetimes, and the Drop trait allows for robust and predictable resource management and cleanup. */
